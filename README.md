# Stats-Project
## Problem statement

DevNation investors are looking to understand how students are engaging in the program, so your job as a data scientists is to use basic statistical methods to summarize and explain the data, so investors can have a better idea of how students are engaging in the program. 


### Hint: You can summarize and explain as you see fit.

Hint: Investors would be really interested to know the following
1.	Average time spent in the class. 
2.	How does average time in class change with the date
3.	How does attendance(total students) change over time
4.	Who are the worst-performing students, in terms of attendance and the total time spent
5.	Plot a box whisker diagram to represent median, upper quartile, lower quartile, and range of time spend in the class. 

## Concepts used in assignment

To solve this use-case, you would need to know how to perform the following
-	Read-write files using pandas
-	Grouping data using pandas and SQL
-	Data visualization using plotly
-	Line chart
-	Bar chart
-	Histogram
